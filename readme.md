# Systems and Methods for Big and Unstructured Data project - A.Y. 2023/2024

This project consisted of choosing two technologies between Neo4J, MongoDB and ElasticSearch and performing some analyses on two datasets of our choosing.
The full project request can be found [__here__]([SMBUD Project - 2023_2024.pdf](https://github.com/LudoTassini/smbud-project-2023/blob/main/SMBUD%20Project%20-%202023_2024.pdf)).

The assignment folder comprises the following:
- the project report in PDF format
- a "Colab Notebooks" folder with the two Python notebooks containing the code for the extra work (one notebook for MongoDB, one notebook for Neo4j)
- a "Cypher Scripts" folder with the Cypher scripts mentioned in section 2.2.3 in the report (for usability reasons)
- a "dump" folder which contains a file with a link to the OneDrive folder with the dumps of the two databases. Notice that the MongoDB dump contains both the output of the mongodump command and a json file generated from the bson file for usability purposes
- a "Pictures" folder with all the images included in the report
- a "Python Scripts" folder with the Python script with which we have splitted the MongoDB dataset
- a "Queries" folder with the queries we have performed (for usability reasons)
